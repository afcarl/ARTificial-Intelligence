# ARTificial-Intelligence
A simple convolutional neural network that attempts to identify the movements and artists of visual art.

This was my final project for CS 7301: Seminar on Statistical Relational Learning and Deep Learning. I took this course in the fall semester of 2014 while I was a master's student at The University of Texas at Dallas. The course was taught by [Vibhav Gogate](http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vgogate/).
